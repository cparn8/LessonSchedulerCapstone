### Music Lesson Scheduler Application Capstone Project

<p>The Music Lesson Scheduling App is a lesson scheduling application designed to let students self-schedule and instructors view and filter lesson schedules. This mobile Android application allows students to create, read, update, and delete music lessons. For instructors, a lesson schedule report generation function tool is available with a search feature to make it simple to efficiently filter to what the instructor needs to find. The addition of this app will save time and reduce instructor burden with self-service scheduling. Fewer no-shows, missed calls, or errors will replace frustration with convenience. This app will help foster musical growth for beginner and advanced students of all ages with a seamless and efficient scheduling process that leaves more time for personal growth through instrument mastery.</p>
